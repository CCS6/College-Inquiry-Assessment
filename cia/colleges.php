            <p>
                The Silliman University School of Public Affairs and Governance believes in governance that looks into the heart rather than at the appearance of things or phenomena (1 Sam 16:7). The school maintains that no facts exist except those that are disclosed in the interpretation of what is already understood (Salazar, 2001). As Salazar aptly puts it, “We can have a million facts in our heads and still remain uneducated.”
